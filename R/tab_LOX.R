#' @title tab_LOX
#' @description \code{tab_LOX} estimates the limit of detection (LOD) and
#'     quantification (LOQ) and returns a data.frame.
#' @details The LOD and LOQ will be calculated as three and ten times the
#'     standard deviation of at least three peak areas divided by the slope
#'     of a linear calibration curve (for workflow ExtCal/ExtGasCal). Results are provided
#'     as element, analyte and relative to a sample mass.
#' @param x Variable containing the numeric data to infer SD (either peak area (for ExtCal/ExtGasCal) or analyte mass (for IDMS/oIDMS)).
#' @param cali_slope A slope from the calibration data.
#' @param wf Calibration method/Workflow.
#' @param mass_fraction2 Mass fraction of the analyte element in the analyte component.
#' @param sample_mass Sample mass.
#'
#' @return A data.frame.
