\usage{
tab_LOX(
  x,
  cali_slope = 1,
  wf = c("ExtCal", "ExtGasCal", "IDMS", "oIDMS"),
  mass_fraction2 = 1,
  sample_mass = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Variable containing the numeric data to infer SD (either peak area (for ExtCal/ExtGasCal) or analyte mass (for IDMS/oIDMS)).}

\item{cali_slope}{A slope from the calibration data.}

\item{wf}{Calibration method/Workflow.}

\item{mass_fraction2}{Mass fraction of the analyte element in the analyte component.}

\item{sample_mass}{Sample mass.}
}
\value{
A data.frame.
}
\description{
\code{tab_LOX} estimates the limit of detection (LOD) and
    quantification (LOQ) and returns a data.frame.
}
\details{
The LOD and LOQ will be calculated as three and ten times the
    standard deviation of at least three peak areas divided by the slope
    of a linear calibration curve (for workflow ExtCal/ExtGasCal). Results are provided
    as element, analyte and relative to a sample mass.
