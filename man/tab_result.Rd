\item{wf}{Calibration method/Workflow.}

\item{a}{Intercept from a calibration model (for ExtCal/ExtGasCal).}

\item{b}{Slope from a calibration model (for ExtCal/ExtGasCal).}

\item{K}{K (for IDMS).}

\item{amae}{Analyte mass as element (for IDMS/oIDMS).}

\item{mass_fraction2}{Mass fraction of the analyte element in the analyte component.}

}
\value{
A data.frame.
}
\description{
\code{tab_result} computes result data from peak data or a data.frame containing at least two numeric columns.
}
\details{
Result data table. Depending on the selected method, the analyte mass will be
calculated from the peak area and calibration data which are provided in data.frames. For the on-line IDMS workflow, values of the
intensity column from a data.frame containing at least two columns are transferred into mass flow data using calibration data from a
data.frame. The analyte mass will be determined via peak integration using the function \code{get_peakdata}. Result data will be provided
for the analyte component itself and as element, as well as content value related to the sample mass.
